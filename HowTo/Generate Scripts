= Generate Scripts

Linecook generates scripts and puts them into a directory. Once you have the
scripts you can compress them, share them, run them, or do whatever you please
- at that point they're ordinary files sitting in a directory. Linecook refers
to the directories containing generated scripts as packages.

The best way to understand how Linecook generates scripts is to start with a
package and work backwards; at each step you can rebuild the package and see
that the same scripts are produced with various degrees of abstraction.  Even better, setup a config/ssh file as described in {Running
Scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/3%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html] and prove the 

run
it to prove that it still works.  The commands to do so are:

  linecook build
  linecook run

The run command must be configured as just discussed in the  tutorial.

== Packages

Packages are by default located in the packages directory. The simplest
package is a directory containing a single executable script.
