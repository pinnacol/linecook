= Run Scripts

Linecook runs scripts using the 'run' command. Internally run copies scripts
to a server using scp and then executes the script using ssh. More
specifically run copies a *package* to the server and executes a script within
the package using ssh. A package is simply a directory containing scripts and
any files the scripts use.

To manually recreate what run does, make a directory with a script, copy it,
and execute as below (assuming you set up the 'abox' server {as described
earlier}[link:files/Tutorial/1%20-%20VM%20Setup.html]):

  mkdir demo
  cat > demo/script.sh <<"DOC"
  echo "# $(whoami)@$(hostname): hello world!"
  DOC
  chmod +x demo/script.sh
  scp -r -P 2220 demo linecook@localhost:/tmp/demo
  ssh -p 2220 linecook@localhost -- "/tmp/demo/script.sh"
  # linecook@abox-ubuntu: hello world!

To simplify this a little, move the redundant information used by scp and ssh
can into a standard ssh config file. Linecook looks for an ssh config file in
'config/ssh' by default:

  mkdir config
  cat > config/ssh <<DOC
  Host abox
  User linecook
  HostName localhost
  Port 2220
  DOC

Now run will copy the package under the 'packages' directory with the same
name as the Host config, and execute the specified script:

  mkdir packages
  mv demo packages/abox
  linecook run --script script.sh abox
  # linecook@abox-ubuntu: hello world!

To run multiple packages at once, simply add more hosts to the ssh config
file. Run copies each package to the appropriate host and then runs the same
script on each (in alphabetic order by host). So say you also set up a 'bbox'
same as 'abox':

  cat >> config/ssh <<DOC
  Host abox
  Port 2220
  
  Host bbox
  Port 2221
  
  Host *
  User linecook
  HostName localhost
  DOC
  cp packages/abox packages/bbox

Then:

  linecook run --script script.sh abox bbox
  # linecook@abox-ubuntu: hello world!
  # linecook@bbox-ubuntu: hello world!

Note that by default run will execute the 'run' script on all hosts configured
in 'config/ssh'. Leveraging these defaults simplifies the last command:

  mv packages/abox/script.sh packages/abox/run
  mv packages/bbox/script.sh packages/bbox/run
  linecook run
  # linecook@abox-ubuntu: hello world!
  # linecook@bbox-ubuntu: hello world!

If you've never used scp/ssh with a config file then this may seem unfamiliar
but hopefully quite graceful. For scp/ssh masters, these are equivalent for
each host:

  linecook run --remote-dir=/tmp/linecook SCRIPT ARGS...
  
  scp -q -r -p -F config/ssh packages/host "host:/tmp/linecook"
  ssh -q -t -t -F config/ssh host -- "/tmp/linecook/SCRIPT ARGS..."

Now that you can run scripts, onward to generating scripts!
