= Shared Folders

Linecook provides support for sharing folders with virtual machines using
{sshfs}[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html] which establishes the share
over ssh. Shared folders are convenient to access the virtual machine for
things like debugging during development, but are not required in any way.

Installation on OS X is pretty easy:

* Download and install {MacFUSE}[http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/]
* Install {Homebrew}[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew]

Then:

  brew install sshfs-fuse

Now you can setup a share using:

  linecook share
