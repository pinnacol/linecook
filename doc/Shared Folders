= Shared Folders

Linecook provides support for sharing folders with virtual machines using
{sshfs}[http://fuse.sourceforge.net/sshfs.html] which establishes the share
over ssh. Shared folders are convenient to access the virtual machine for
things like debugging during development, but are not required in any way.

== Installation on OS X:

* Download and install {MacFUSE}[http://code.google.com/p/macfuse/]
* Install {Homebrew}[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew]

If you are using Snow Leopard (ignore for Leopard), the MacFUSE configurations
need to be tweaked in order to keep things running (see this
{issue}[https://github.com/mxcl/homebrew/issues/3340]). As per this
{patch}[https://gist.github.com/544112], open the pkgconfig/fuse.pc file and
change the Libs config to use -lfuse_ino64 like this:

 [/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig/fuse.pc]
 Libs: -L${libdir} -lfuse_ino64 -pthread  -liconv

Then:

  brew install sshfs-fuse

Now you can setup a share using:

  linecook share
