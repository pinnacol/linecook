= VM Control

Linecook provides these commands to control VirtualBox VMs:

  # ex: 'linecook start'
  start              start a vm
  stop               stop a vm
  state              print the vm state
  save               take a vm snapshop
  ssh                ssh to a vm

Most of these commands wrap the VirtualBox command line tool VBoxManage in
very simple ways. With these commands it's straightforward to make an
iterative script development workflow to build a server component, save the
server state, build another component, and then at any time reset and rebuild
the whole thing from scratch.

Linecook uses a standard ssh config file to run scripts; the same config file
is also used to configure the VM control commands. More details are presented
in the section on {running
scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/3%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html], but suffice to
say an ssh config file like this will access the 'abox' VM built during {VM
Setup}[link:files/Tutorial/1%20-%20VM%20Setup.html]:

  [config/ssh]
  Host abox
  HostName localhost
  User linecook
  Port 2220

Now you can control the VM like this:

  # start the VM, resetting to a snapshot
  linecook start --snapshot base
  
  # ssh to the VM
  linecook ssh
  
  # take a snapshot
  linecook snapshot modified
  
  # reset a snapshot, removing all children
  linecook snapshot --reset base
  
  # stop the VM and go home
  linecook stop

== Multiple VMs

To control multiple VMs, build and configure ssh access to each. For example
make a 'bbox' VM as before but configure ssh access on port 2221:

  - name: bbox
  - hostname: bbox-ubuntu
  VBoxManage modifyvm bbox --natpf1 'bbox-ssh,tcp,,2221,,22'

Now add an entry for bbox in the ssh config file (note the * Host can be used
to declare default settings):

  [config/ssh]
  Host abox
  Port 2220
  
  Host bbox
  Port 2221
  
  Host *
  HostName localhost
  User linecook

Now same linecook commands will control both VMs:

  # start all (or a subset) the VMs to a known snapshot
  linecook start --snapshot base
  linecook start --snapshot base abox
  
  # ssh to the VMs one at a time
  linecook ssh abox
  linecook ssh bbox
  
  # move the current snapshot forward for all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook snapshot modified
  linecook snapshot modified abox
  
  # reset a snapshot, removing all children for all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook snapshot --reset base
  linecook snapshot --reset base abox
  
  # stop all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook stop
  linecook stop abox

== Host and VM Names

The Host config corresponds to the package name that will be run on the VM; ie
the 'abox.yml' package goes to the 'abox' Host. Implicitly the VM will also be
named 'abox' in VirtualBox (such that if you opened the VirtualBox application
you'd see 'abox'). If you name it something else, then declare the actual VM
name next to the Host config using a linecook-specific comment like this:

  [config/ssh]
  ...
  Host abox    # [the_vm_name]
  ...

The Host config, 'abox' in this case, is the input for all linecook commands;
linecook resolves the VM name internally when interacting with VirtualBox.
