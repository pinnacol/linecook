= VM Control

Linecook uses the VirtualBox command line tool VBoxManage to control virtual
machines. Obviously, only VirtualBox VMs can be controlled in this way. 

Linecook uses a standard ssh config file when running scripts. The same ssh
config file is also used to control the VMs, so set one up like this (see 'man
ssh_config' for more details and other configuration options):

  [config/ssh]
  Host abox
  HostName localhost
  User linecook
  Port 2220
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/socket-%r@%h:%p

Now you can control the box via these linecook commands.

  # start the VM at a snapshot
  linecook start --snapshot base
  
  # ssh to the VM
  linecook ssh
  
  # take a snapshot
  linecook snapshot modified
  
  # reset to a snapshot, removing all children
  linecook reset base
  
  # stop the VM and go home
  linecook stop

== Multiple VMs

To develop multiple (potentially interacting) VMs, build each as in {VM
Setup}[link:files/Tutorial/1%20-%20VM%20Setup.html] but customize access to
each machine on the host. For example if you made an 'bbox' virtual machine:

  - name: bbox
  - hostname: bbox-ubuntu
  
  VBoxManage modifyvm bbox --natpf1 'bbox-ssh,tcp,,2221,,22'

Now add an entry for the host in the ssh config file (you can DRY up the
config file using the * host for default settings):

  [config/ssh]
  Host abox
  Port 2220
  
  Host bbox
  Port 2221
  
  Host *
  HostName localhost
  User linecook
  UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
  StrictHostKeyChecking no
  IdentitiesOnly yes
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath /tmp/socket-%r@%h:%p

The same linecook commands will now operate on a set of VMs:

  # start all (or a subset) the VMs to a known snapshot
  linecook start --snapshot base
  linecook start --snapshot base abox
  
  # move the current snapshot forward for all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook snapshot modified
  linecook snapshot modified abox
  
  # checkout the results, one at a time
  linecook ssh abox
  linecook ssh bbox
  
  # reset to a snapshot, removing all children for all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook reset base
  linecook reset base abox
  
  # stop all (or a subset) the VMs
  linecook stop
  linecook stop abox

As described later, the host config corresponds to the package run on it; ie
the 'abox.yml' package goes to the 'abox' host. Implicitly the VM will also be
named 'abox' in VirtualBox. If you name it something else, declare the VM name
using a linecook-specific comment next to the Host declaration like this:

  [config/ssh]
  ...
  Host abox    # [the_vm_name]
  ...

The actual host config value is the input for all linecook commands; linecook
resolves the VM name internally when interacting with VirtualBox.
