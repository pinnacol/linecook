= Intro

Linecook provides tools to generate scripts and run them on servers. Scripts
are what Linecook makes, and in a sense so are the servers on which the
scripts are run.

Linecook consists of the following. Arrows indicate composition, labeled
arrows indicate linecook commands, and products are in parenthesis.

  = Components =
  
  attributes
  helpers
  |-----> recipes -> packages -a-> (scripts) -b-> (servers) <-c- server setup
  files
  templates
  
  = Commands =
  ex: 'linecook build' on the command line
  
  a) env, helper, package, build        # build scripts
  b) run                                # run scripts
  c) start, stop, ssh, snapshot, reset  # server setup/control

Everything to the left of 'scripts' has to do with generating scripts;
everything to the right with running scripts on servers. While generating
scripts is the prime utility of Linecook, it's helpful to start by running
scripts so you can see how the whole system works.

To run a script, you need a server. Linecook provides a workflow to develop
scripts on virtual machines managed by
{VirtualBox}[http://www.virtualbox.org]. Nothing says you have to use
VirtualBox, any server you can access via ssh will do, but if you roll your
own then everything to the right of 'servers' will not apply.

If you already have a server, skip to {Running
Scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/3%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html]. Otherwise setup
a Ubuntu server using VirtualBox, as described
{next}[link:files/Tutorial/1%20-%20VM%20Setup.html].
