= Intro

Linecook does two things - it generates scripts and runs scripts on servers.
Scripts are what Linecook makes, and in a sense so are the servers on which
the scripts are run.

Linecook consists of the following. Arrows indicate composition, labeled
arrows indicate linecook commands, and the products of Linecook are in
parenthesis.

  = Components =
  attributes
  helpers
  |-----> recipes -> packages -a-> (scripts) -b-> (servers) <-c- server setup
  files
  templates
  
  = Commands =
  a) env, helper, package, build        # build scripts
  b) run                                # run scripts
  c) start, stop, ssh, snapshot, reset  # server setup/control

Everything to the left of 'scripts' has to do with generating scripts;
everything to the right with running scripts on servers. While generating
scripts is the primary function of Linecook, it's helpful to start by running
scripts so you can see how Linecook works in action.

To run a script, you need a script. For the sake of learning use this script
and substitute with a more meaningful script later:

  cat > script.sh <<DOC
  echo "# $(whoami)@$(hostname): hello world!"
  DOC
  chmod +x script.sh

You also need a server. Linecook provides a workflow to develop scripts on
virtual machines managed by {VirtualBox}[http://www.virtualbox.org]. Nothing
says you have to use VirtualBox; any server you can access via ssh will do,
but note that everything to the right of 'servers' will not apply.

If you already have a server, skip to {Running
Scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/3%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html]. Otherwise setup
a Ubuntu server using VirtualBox, as described next.
