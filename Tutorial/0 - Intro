= Intro

Linecook does two things - it provides a way to generate scripts and a way to
run scripts on servers. A script is output of the former and input to the
latter.

For the sake of learning use this script for now and substitute with a more meaningful script later:

  cat > script.sh <<DOC
  echo "# $(whoami)@$(hostname): hello world!"
  DOC
  chmod +x script.sh

You'll also need a server. Linecook provides a workflow to develop scripts on
a virtual machine managed by {VirtualBox}[http://www.virtualbox.org].
Specifically the linecook executable may start and stop virtual machines, take
snapshots and restore them. Nothing says you have to use VirtualBox.

Running scripts simply requires ssh access; any server you can access via ssh
may be a target for Linecook. If you already have a server, skip to {Running
Scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/2%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html]. Otherwise setup
a server using VirtualBox, as described next.
