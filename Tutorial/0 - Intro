= Intro

The best way to understand Linecook is to start with a script.

Linecook provides two distinct functions; a way to generate scripts and a way
to run scripts remotely. A script is output of the former and input to the
latter.  If you don't already have a script, use this one:

  cat > script.sh <<DOC
  echo "# hello from $(whoami) at $(hostname)"
  DOC
  chmod +x script.sh

You'll also need a server. If you already have a server, skip to {Running Scripts}[link:files/Tutorial/2%20-%20Running%20Scripts.html].
