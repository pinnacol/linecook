= VM Setup

VirtualBox runs virtual machines on your local box. Local VMs help minimize
development cycles because they are quick to access and reset. In addition,
VirtualBox allows snapshots which can save and restore a particular server
state - this functionality enables iterative development.

To set up a Ubuntu VM using VirtualBox:

1. Download and Install VirtualBox (http://www.virtualbox.org)
2. Download a Ubuntu ISO (http://www.ubuntu.com/server/get-ubuntu/download)
3. Build the Box

When done, see the documentation for {controlling a
VM}[link:files/Tutorial/2%20-%20VM%20Control.html]

== Building a Ubuntu Box

Use the VirtualBox wizard to get started. The name and other settings (ex
user, ssh port) may be changed but be sure to propagate changes throughout the
setup process.

  - name: abox
  - Linux/Ubuntu
  - 512 MB memory
  - 8 GB dynamically resizing drive

Add the Ubuntu iso to the cd/dvd device under Settings > Storage. Now start
the server and install Ubuntu (use default settings unless specified):

  - hostname: abox-ubuntu
  - user/password: linecook
  - select 'OpenSSH server' in packages to install

When the server has rebooted and is at the login screen, remove the install
iso, take a snapshot, and setup port forwarding. Port forwarding allows you to
access the ssh port (22) on the VM via a port on your local box (2220).

  (Devices > CD/DVD Devices > Remove disk from virtual drive)
  VBoxManage snapshot abox take RAW
  VBoxManage controlvm abox poweroff
  # wait to fully power off
  VBoxManage modifyvm abox --natpf1 'abox-ssh,tcp,,2220,,22'
  VBoxManage -q snapshot abox restore RAW
  VBoxManage startvm abox

Transfer your ssh key to the VM (notice port 2220). Help to generate ssh keys
can be found on {GitHub}[http://help.github.com/key-setup-redirect]:

  scp -P 2220 -o UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub linecook@localhost:id_rsa.pub
  
Login as linecook and setup SSH access:

  vm: mkdir .ssh
  vm: mv id_rsa.pub .ssh/authorized_keys
  vm: chmod 0700 .ssh
  vm: chmod 0600 .ssh/authorized_keys

Remove the login banner (as a convenience) and exit:

  vm: sudo rm /etc/motd
  vm: exit

Now take a base snapshot:

  VBoxManage snapshot abox take BASE
  VBoxManage controlvm abox poweroff

To cleanup port forwarding (run later, if ever):

  VBoxManage modifyvm abox --natpf1 delete 'abox-ssh'

The same procedure can be repeated to build other VMs. Nothing is special
about this setup. The os, name, port, and other settings may be changed to
your liking - all that Linecook requires is ssh access.
