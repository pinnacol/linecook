# Normalization:
* if not package then assume recipes => basename
* hashify package targets
* arrayify cookbook gems/paths
* if not manifest, build cookbook

# Wrap controls in package.  built? true if all package targets
# are in the registry.  Split out functionality as possible.
# Package doesn't do normalization itself... just read.  Add
# defaults if necessary but assume it is correct.

# Typical Examples
